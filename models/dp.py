"""
Differential privacy utilities (stub).

This module contains placeholder classes and functions that illustrate
where and how differential privacy (DP) mechanisms could be integrated
into the behavioural authentication pipeline.  The real DP routines
require access to a DP library (e.g. Opacus for PyTorch or TensorFlow
Privacy) and careful tuning of noise scales and privacy budgets.  Those
dependencies are not included in this scaffold.

    Placeholder class to illustrate DP noise addition to model updates.

    In a federated learning setting, each client computes a gradient or
    parameter update based on its local data.  To protect individual
    contributions, DP mechanisms add noise to these updates before they
    are aggregated.  This class provides a ``sanitise`` method that
    perturbs updates with Gaussian noise.  In practice you should use
    calibrated noise based on a formal privacy accountant.
