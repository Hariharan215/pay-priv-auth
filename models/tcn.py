"""
Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) placeholder.

Behavioural biometrics often benefit from sequence models that capture
temporal patterns in sensor readings.  A Temporal Convolutional Network
(TCN) is a 1‑D convolutional architecture that has been successfully
applied to time‑series classification tasks.  This module contains a stub
implementation of a TCN encoder with the same interface as the baseline
logistic regression model.  For a full implementation you will need to
integrate a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
