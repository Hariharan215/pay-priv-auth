# Behavioral Biometric Authentication for Card-Not-Present (CNP) Payments

## Problem Statement
Card-not-present (CNP) payment transactions, such as e-commerce purchases, require robust customer authentication that balances security, privacy, and user experience. Traditional methods like one-time passwords (OTP) provide a possession factor, but PSD2 regulations also require an inherence factor for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).

## Behavioral Biometrics as Inherence Factor
Behavioral biometrics—how a user types, swipes, or holds a device—can serve as an inherence factor under PSD2. This approach enables invisible, background authentication, maintaining a frictionless checkout experience and reducing cart abandonment.

## Privacy and Regulatory Challenges
Leveraging behavioral signals introduces privacy concerns, as it involves monitoring sensitive user interaction patterns. To comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR), the system must avoid storing or exposing raw personal data and ensure that biometric processing is secure and transparent.

## Security Requirements
The authentication system must achieve a very low false-acceptance rate for unauthorized users, meeting regulatory standards for fraud prevention and SCA.

## Solution Goals
- **Enhance fraud prevention** for CNP payments using behavioral biometrics
- **Uphold user privacy** by not storing or exposing raw personal data
- **Minimize user friction** for a seamless checkout experience
- **Comply with PSD2 SCA** (inherence + another factor)
- **Adhere to GDPR** and other relevant data protection regulations
